# FX-Trader
This is a hobby project aimed at building an FX trading tool.

## Aim
- Generate Buy - Sell Signals on EUR/USD

## Data Sources
- OANDA v20 REST API - https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/introduction/
- You can open a Demo Account for free here & you will get a Paper Trading account, and API Key (It was a bit tricky for me so if you face issues please get in touch with me).

## Future Scope
- Expansion into all Majors, Minors & Exotics.
- Integrate Fundamental & Geopolitical Factors that influence FX movements
- Training the famed Hidden Markov Model (and other Stochastic Processes) on historical data & trying to predict short-term price action.

## Note 
- I'm not trained in Stochastic Processes, Python, etc. I'm self-taught. 
- I don't believe in Market Prediction. I believe in educated bets. 
- Some Mathematical Methods may help, this is a journey to discover which ones do.
